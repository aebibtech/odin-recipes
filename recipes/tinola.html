            <li>2 lb (907.2 g) chicken wings and drummettes</li>
            <li>5 tbsp fish sauce</li>
            <li>½ yellow onion chopped</li>
            <li>5 cloves garlic minced</li>
            <li>2 inches of ginger julienned</li>
            <li>6 c filtered water more if necessary</li>
            <li>2 small chayote cut into ½ inch cubes</li>
            <li>1 tbsp vegetable oil</li>
            <li>4 c spinach cleaned</li>
            <li>1 c moringa leaves stripped and cleaned</li>
            <li>½ tsp black pepper</li>
            <li>salt to taste</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Pat the chicken dry and put it in a storage container. Pour two tablespoons of fish sauce into the bowl and mix to make sure the chicken is thoroughly coated. Cover the container with a lid and marinate on the counter for at least two hours. Note: If you put the chicken in the fridge to marinate, you need to remove it at least 20 minutes before cooking to bring it to room temperature, otherwise the chicken will cook unevenly.</li>
            <li>In a pot over medium heat, add the vegetable oil and the onions. Saute for about one to two minutes or until the onions are translucent. Add the garlic and ginger and cook for one minute until fragrant, but not burned.</li>
            <li>Add the chicken into the pot and stir all the ingredients. Continue to the chicken in the pot for 6-8 minutes or until the chicken is brown on the outside, or the internal chicken temperature reads 135 °F.</li>
            <li>Add the water and the rest of the fish sauce into the pot and stir. Raise the heat to medium-high and bring to a boil.</li>
            <li>Lower the heat to medium-low and continue a simmer for about 30 minutes covered with the lid.</li>
            <li>Remember to stir occasionally and skim the fat and scum off the top of the soup.</li>
            <li>Add the chayote and continue to cook for 8 minutes or until the chayote is soft and you can pierce it easily with a fork.</li>
            <li>Add all the spinach.</li>
            <li>Immediately add all the moringa, then cook for up to one minute to soften the leaves.</li>
            <li>Taste test the soup and add the black pepper. If necessary, add additional salt or pepper to taste. The chicken should be tender and the internal temperature should read 165 °F.</li>
        </ol>
